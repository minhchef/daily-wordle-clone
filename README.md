A Wordle Clone follows the same basic principles as the original Wordle game, with some potential variations. Here are the standard rules:

1. Objective
Guess the secret five-letter word in six attempts or fewer.

2. Gameplay Rules
Each guess must be a valid five-letter word.
After submitting a guess, the game provides feedback by coloring the letters:
Green üü©: The letter is correct and in the correct position.
Yellow üü®: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
Gray ‚¨ú: The letter is not in the word at all.
You cannot guess random letter combinations; only actual words are allowed.
Players use the feedback to refine their guesses in subsequent attempts.
3. Winning & Losing
Win üéâ: If you guess the correct word within six attempts, you win.
Lose ‚ùå: If you use all six attempts without finding the correct word, you lose, and the secret word is revealed.
